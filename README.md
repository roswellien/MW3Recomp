# MechWarrior 3 Recomp

**Original gameplay. A modern core.**

An experimental native recompilation of MechWarrior 3, with Vulkan rendering,
modern Windows services, an optional enhanced visual profile, and developing
map and mission editing tools. The aim is to preserve the original game's
logic and behavior while making it usable on modern systems.

## What the project does

The native host executes recompiled original 32-bit game logic in a project-built
64-bit application. Project-authored services handle graphics, input, audio,
files and Windows integration. Vulkan is the selected graphics backend.
Modernization preserves original gameplay; visual and behavioral enhancements
need separate configuration and comparison against original-compatible behavior.

The local development build has run startup, the animated menu, Training,
Instant Action and selected campaign play, including normal shutdown. The
October 20 work added launcher repairs, all 18 chassis in the enhanced profile,
32-bit depth rendering, and fixes for objectives input and damage-display colors.
A player confirmed the reported Operation 1 → Operation 2 transition repair.
These observations do not establish complete campaign compatibility or fidelity.

| Area | Current development capabilities | Remaining work |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Native gameplay | Live menu, Training, Instant Action, selected campaign play and original HUD | Broader campaign, saves, physics/AI/timing comparisons and sustained playtests |
| Vulkan graphics | Ultrawide output, window modes, FXAA, anisotropic filtering, SSAA and improved depth precision | Broader hardware coverage, performance and visual regressions |
| Enhanced visuals | Optional updated models, textures, material normals and environment lighting in local profiles | Asset distribution review, damage/LOD/muzzle checks and remaining lighting effects |
| Launcher | Installation validation, graphics choices, model selection and local preparation | Portable runtime import/build and first-run installation |
| Mod Tools | Top-down editor and browser Map Studio prototypes with project save/edit/export paths | Portable setup, input hardening and native custom-mission validation |
| Pirate's Moon | Experimental native startup/menu/Options/quit slice | Missions, cinematics and broader input/play validation |

The separately maintained **D7VK compatibility track** runs the original 32-bit
executable through a Vulkan wrapper. It is a distinct launch option, not the
native host or a fallback inside it. See [wrapper status](docs/d7vk-wrapper-launcher-summary.md).
MW4 remains a later target.

## In-game development

These October 19 trailer captures show the optional enhanced profile with
replacement visuals and a filming camera. They are real development footage,
not a promise that those assets are included in a download. The
[media page](docs/media/README.md) explains capture scope and links the evolution videos.

## Downloads and user setup

Two separate packages are being prepared:

- **Game / Launcher for Windows x64:** import the user's supported original
  installation, prepare the required runtime locally and launch through the GUI.
  Portable setup and distribution review are still open. Follow
  [game setup and current limits](docs/setup-game.md).
- **Mod Tools source preview:** a separate editor package with its own setup
  instructions and dependency checks. It reads the user's own archives and
  keeps extracted caches and exports local. See [Mod Tools setup](docs/setup-mod-tools.md).

Do not treat an existing development shortcut or the current Inno installer
script as a self-contained playable release. The release preparation record is
[here](docs/public-release-readiness.md).

## Mod Tools

The [Mod Tools](games/mw3/mod-tools/README.md) are a separate workstream and will
have a separate download/setup path from the Game / Launcher.

- **Map & Mission Editor:** a desktop top-down view with object selection,
  movement, property editing, undo/redo, saved projects and isolated local export.
- **Visual Map Studio:** a browser-based 3D preview and placement prototype with
  lighting controls and experimental map-pack generation.
- **Format documentation:** recovered archive structures and a
  [support matrix](games/mw3/mod-tools/docs/format-support-matrix.md) that identifies
  unresolved fields.

Editing or exporting a project does not establish that its custom mission plays
correctly. Original preview geometry is extracted locally; it is not bundled.
Exported archives may contain original-derived material and are not automatically
shareable community packs. See [setup](docs/setup-mod-tools.md) and the
[distribution policy](docs/legal.md).

The current browser prototype, captured October 21. This local workspace has
extracted preview assets; the separate source package does not include them.

## Build the asset-free runtime

These commands document the development build. They cannot run from this
documentation-only public checkout; the required source and build files are private.

The bootstrap needs CMake 3.24+, a C++20 compiler and Python 3.11+. It builds
project-authored runtime components and tests without installing or downloading
game content. This is separate from building the integrated game host.

```sh
cmake --preset default
cmake --build --preset default
ctest --preset default
```

On Windows, use Visual Studio's C++ developer shell and add `-A x64` to the
configure command when using its generator. With Clang on Linux:

```sh
cmake --preset default -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=clang++
```

Use a separate build directory when changing compilers. See
[contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md), [dependencies](docs/dependencies.md) and the
[native-host build notes](tools/m4-crt-heap-carry/README.md) for their distinct scopes.

## Help develop and test

Public contributions currently focus on documentation, questions and reproducible
playtest feedback. Source-code contributions will open with the source release.

Read the [October 21 development update](docs/development-update-2026-10-21.md)
for the current presentation, setup and source-readability work.

Read the [contribution guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [code guide](docs/code-guide.md)
to find the maintained entry points. Useful contributions include reproducible
bug reports, focused contract tests, readable host-service code, documentation,
hardware playtesting and editor improvements. Never attach original media, memory
dumps, private logs or generated game translations to public issues.

| Reference | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [Roadmap](docs/roadmap.md) | Development direction and remaining validation |
| [Faithful modernization plan](docs/faithful-modernization-plan.md) | Original behavior, native execution and modernization contracts |
| [Latest recorded daily update](docs/mechlab/2026-10-20.md) | October 20 changes and their limits |
| [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) | Guest ABI, runtime and graphics boundaries |
| [Milestones](docs/project-milestones.md) | Evidence and formal acceptance criteria |
| [First native function proof](docs/mw3-leaf-experiment.md) | A bounded original/native comparison |

Formal acceptance remains **131/144 selected startup roots**. This is a specific
evidence set, not overall project completion. Live execution, optional enhanced
visuals, saved replay and original-process diagnostics have different scopes.
