# Owens default texture audit — 2026-10-24

The detailed Owens is original-MW3-derived. Seven source-family tiles were compared with their current default versions. The small blue and yellow service line, white curved body stripes, missile opening layout and prominent yellow/black pod warning stripes are retained. The current texture tiles add clearer armor seams, metallic wear and recess detail. In the existing detailed-model render, the dark missile mouths are intentional openings; mechanical areas show textured variation rather than broad flat-black paint. No missing identifying detail or finish defect warranted another color edit.

The installed default Owens BWTEX1 payload has 108 batch indices and 42 material records. Its complete material-record bytes match a fresh encoding of the current selected `local/remaster/models.json` images exactly, with zero differing bytes. No mesh, pack, registry, normal, alternate-skin, gameplay or runtime file was changed.

Private Drive review (private review link omitted) contains a source-versus-current tile board and the current detailed-model torso render. Local comparison output is in ignored `local/work-ahead/owens-default-audit-20261024-r1/`; game media remains local. No commit was made. This audit earns no native-game acceptance credit; the retained count remains 131/144.
