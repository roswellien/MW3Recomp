# Contributing to MW34 RECOMP

This public repository currently contains documentation and screenshots. Use Issues
for questions and reviewed playtest feedback, and pull requests for documentation
corrections. Code/build/test guidance below describes the private development
repository; source contributions will open with the planned source release.

Work on MechWarrior 3 first. Start with an observation, record its evidence,
then make the smallest change that preserves the observed behavior.

## Before starting

Use the [code guide](docs/code-guide.md) to find the active component. Check open
issues and describe substantial changes before investing in a redesign. Bug fixes,
hardware playtest reports, Mod Tools improvements and clear documentation are
welcome. Keep a pull request focused on one behavior or one readability concern.
Do not mix a large formatting pass with gameplay or renderer changes.

Follow the [faithful modernization plan](docs/faithful-modernization-plan.md):
preserve recompiled gameplay while implementing modern platform services behind
observed contracts. State the execution boundary advanced by each implementation
and validate it narrowly. Existing acceptance gates remain strict; backend
fixtures, original-game hooks and saved-scene replay are not native gameplay.
For documentation-only changes, check links, diff and evidence consistency;
do not launch game captures or full verifier runs solely to update documents.

Read [the distribution policy](docs/legal.md) before adding files. Never submit
game executables, media, assets, memory dumps, or unreviewed generated code.
Keep user inputs under ignored `local/` (or outside the checkout), and analysis
output under ignored `reports/`. Ignore rules are a convenience, not proof that
a commit is safe: inspect `git diff --cached` before committing.

Use C++20 for the runtime and Python 3.11+ standard library for lightweight
offline analysis. The asset-free bootstrap needs no external runtime libraries;
the separate Mod Tools preview has its own pinned dependencies and setup guide.
Proposed dependencies must record license, exact version/commit, integrity
hash where available, and why an existing dependency cannot do the job.

Build and run CTest as described in the README. Tests use only project-authored
fixtures. Cover malformed PE data and boundary conditions for memory changes.
Do not add game files to CI. Run `cmake --build build/default --target format`
when clang-format is installed; `format-check` verifies formatting. Enable
`MW34_ENABLE_CLANG_TIDY` with a Ninja or Makefiles generator for optional
compiler-integrated static analysis. CMake's Visual Studio generator does not
run clang-tidy; on Windows, use Ninja from a developer command prompt.

The asset-free CMake tests, launcher tests and local original-game comparisons
have different prerequisites. State which you ran and which require private
inputs. The Mod Tools currently include local-installation integration scripts;
do not describe them as asset-free CI tests. The public setup/package path is
tracked in [release readiness](docs/public-release-readiness.md).

## Readable, maintainable code

Write modules around a clear responsibility and describe their entry points,
input/output formats, ownership and failure behavior. Prefer descriptive names
and small named helpers over compressed one-line control flow. Comments should
explain why a constraint exists, a binary layout, units, a lifecycle rule or an
unusual ABI/FP contract; avoid restating obvious assignments. Include enough
context that a developer can understand the code without this project's chats.

Keep unresolved guest functions named `sub_XXXXXXXX` and retain evidence-backed
addresses. Human readability does not justify invented gameplay semantics.
Preserve frozen source models, hashes and historical evidence. Refactor maintained
code with narrow checks; propose separate replacements for pinned historical tools
rather than silently formatting or renaming their source.

For Mod Tools, keep the original installation read-only and place caches/projects/
exports in a separate writable location. Validate identifiers, paths and sizes
before file access or process launch. Exported game archives are local derived
content; a successful export does not authorize sharing it or prove native play.

## Issues and pull requests

For a bug, include the component/build, OS/GPU/driver when relevant, the supported
game profile, steps to reproduce, expected result and actual result. Attach only
reviewed, redacted logs/screenshots. Never upload archives, executables, memory
dumps, saves containing original data or generated translations to an issue.

A pull request should explain the problem and resulting behavior, list meaningful
checks and their results, and identify remaining limits. For native behavior,
name the execution boundary changed and the original comparison or fixture used.
For docs, review links and claims. New dependencies need exact pins, provenance
and applicable license notices. Include notices in the package as well as source.

Follow the project's existing license for your own contributions and identify
third-party material explicitly. This draft adds no contributor agreement or
mandatory external service. Release publication, repository visibility and any
history replacement remain maintainer decisions after review.

For findings, include executable SHA-256, RVA/VA distinction, tool and version,
method, confidence, reproducible evidence, and unresolved alternatives. Keep
unknown functions named `sub_XXXXXXXX`; only add semantic aliases with evidence.
Distinguish tests of synthetic code from validation of real game behavior.

Changes to timing, rendering, or input behavior need an original-behavior
baseline. Unknown APIs must fail explicitly; a success-returning placeholder
must never masquerade as compatibility. No remote repository or release is
created automatically by this bootstrap.
